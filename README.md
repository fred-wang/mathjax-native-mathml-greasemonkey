MathJax Native MathML (GreaseMonkey)
------------------------------------

The GreaseMonkey script in this repository forces MathJax/KaTeX to use the
native MathML. It is installable from
[OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/fred.wang/MathJax_Native_MathML).

This script is also available as a
[Safari Extension](https://github.com/fred-wang/mathjax-native-mathml-safari).
For Gecko-based browsers, we recommend installing [this more advanced add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/addon/mathjax-native-mathml/) instead.
